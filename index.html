                    <img src="./home/buLogo.png" alt="BU Logo">
                    <p>I am currently a third year undergraduate student studying Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration. 
                        Finance fascinates me including its interactions with technology, and I am looking for opportunities to explore this 
                        interest. With experience since a young kid with computer science and creating businesses, I have learned to love problem 
                        solving and stay curious to new ideas. My previous experience over my first and second internships at Deloitte has allowed 
                        me the unique opportunity to collaborate with teams across the country, and apply these problem solving skills. Constantly, 
                        I look for ways to refine these skills through external coding or research projects in cryptocurrency markets and business 
                        applications. I am currently looking for a challenging environment to apply this passion for technology towards unique 
                        challenges in a rapidly evolving environments.</p>
